I'm a Computer Science major at the University of Minnesota ‚Äì Twin Cities (UMN), and I'm currently dedicated to building meaningful software that improves lives.
My focus lies in integrating ML/AI into software to maximize productivity and convenience.

### ML Software Engineer Intern at [Lee Group](https://sites.google.com/view/wlee-group/people) @ University of Colorado Denver
- Helped scientiests figure out the 3D structure of molecules with [POKY](https://sites.google.com/view/pokynmr) software.
- Utilized AI model(ESMFold, BOLTZ-1, and CHAI-1) to predict the 3D shape of a molecule.
- Predicted the molecule's fingerprint using the softwar librarieslike CSPred and SHIFTX2.
- Matched the found fingerprint with the massive BMRB database using efficient bi-graph algorithms.

### Founder @ [Dotori](https://dotori-intro-website.vercel.app/)
The goal is to help students get into their dream colleges by assiting them with AI along the applicaiton process.
- Designed and Built a user-friendly UI using Figma and Next.js.
- Built a robust authentication backend system in Spring Boot using Google Oauth 2.0.
- Built a CI/CD pipeline with Github Actions to streamline the Integration and Deployment process.
